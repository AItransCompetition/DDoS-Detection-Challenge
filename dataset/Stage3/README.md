In this sub-problem, we introduce more complex variations of flow characteristics relative to the previous sub-problem, and generate less differentiated attack streams by fitting them to the background streams. In addition to this, we introduce a more complex background flow model.

#### Format of train_labels.txt

The first line indicates the number of flows. Each flow is represented by a quintuple: {Source IP}-{Destination IP}-{Source Port}-{Destination Port}-{Protocol}. The submitted file's format should be the same.
